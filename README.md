# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

This was a challenge from Frontend Mentor that can be found [here](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/four-card-feature-section-weK1eFYK)

This was my first of these challenges where I went away from vanilla HTML and CSS to do it all in React. This is part of a series where I am brushing up on my CSS to hone my skills.
